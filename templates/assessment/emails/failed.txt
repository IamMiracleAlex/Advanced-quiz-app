Dear {{ first_name }},


We were all very excited to meet with you over the past few days. We have been impressed with your background and career objectives.

However, we have had several exciting applications and would not be moving forward with your application at this time. 

You may always apply for the next program or any of our programs.

Hope to see you soon.


Kind regards, 

Career Acceleration Program Team
